### Bottles
The small silicon ones don't leak, so we prefer them.  
Fill to 3, add 3 scoops of water, top up with milk from fridge.  
He would usually have 3 or 4 per day. 1 in the morning, 1 before nap time, 1 before bed. If you offer him a fourth during the day he might take it.  

**Note**: Bottles shouldn't be kept out of the fridge for more than two hours
- 06:00 - 08:00 if he wakes up early
- offer him one after breakfast, he probably won't take it, try again in an hour
- before he takes a nap, in bed with lights off
- offer him one after lunch, he probably won't take it, try again in an hour
- 19:30 - 20:30 in bed with lights off, he will probably fall asleep before he finishes it

## Notes
- Keep his bedroom door closed, so he doesn't fall down the stairs! Probably best to keep all doors closed.
- If he's unhappy, he's hungry, thirsty, tired, or pooping!
- YouTube Ms. Rachel will usually calm him down, or can be used to help get him to eat.
