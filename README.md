### Breakfast
porridge, 3 scoops    
add berries or banana (optional)

### Lunch
prepared meal  
- yogurt

- fruit
- biscuit

### Dinner
prepared meal  
- yogurt

### Bottles
The small silicon ones don't leak, so we prefer them.  
Fill to 3, add 3 scoops of water, top up with milk from fridge.  
He would usually have 3 or 4 per day. 1 in the morning, 1 before nap time, 1 before bed. If you offer him a fourth during the day he might take it.  

**Note**: Bottles shouldn't be kept out of the fridge for more than two hours
- 06:00 - 08:00 if he wakes up early
- offer him one after breakfast, he probably won't take it, try again in an hour
- before he takes a nap, in bed with lights off
- offer him one after lunch, he probably won't take it, try again in an hour
- 19:30 - 20:30 in bed with lights off, he will probably fall asleep before he finishes it

## Notes
- Keep his bedroom door closed, so he doesn't fall down the stairs! Probably best to keep all doors closed.
- If he's unhappy, he's hungry, thirsty, tired, or pooping!
- YouTube Ms. Rachel will usually calm him down, or can be used to help get him to eat.

## Rooms

### Bathroom
#### Heater
It's not heated like the rest of the house. There is an electric heater, the switch is outside the door, the single one on it's own. I normally turn it on when running the bath and turn it off when he gets in. Please don't forget to turn it off!
#### Bath
The baby bath doesn't fit under the tab so use the shower head to fill it. Pull up the knob in the center of the tap to use the shower head. You shouldn't need to adjust the temperature. There is a star shaped, white and green thermometer in the bathroom. Bath should be 36 - 38 degrees. It will blink red if it's too hot.  
There's a jug for washing his hair and baby soap in the bathroom. And some toys he likes to play with!
### Rafa's Room
##### Lights
One of the light switches by the door controls the main lights but we don't use them.
There's a light on the wall over his bed, it can be controlled on / off by the switch next to it but we use Google to control it.  
`Hey Google spare room light on|off`  
`Hey Google spare room light white|red|blue`  
`Hey Google spare room light 100%|50%|1%`  
##### Display
We use the display in his room to play white noise when he's sleeping.  
`Hey Google play white noise`  
You can also use it to play Ms Rachel if he's very upset or wakes up and won't go back to sleep.  
`Hey Google play Ms Rachel videos on YouTube`  
and
`Hey Google stop`  
when you no longer need it!
### Downstairs
The TV has Netflix and Amazon if you'd like to watch something.  
You can also use YouTube Kids to play videos for Rafa.  
Turn on the TV (it takes a while to turn on!) and press the Home button to select Netflix, Amazon, YouTube Kids, etc.  
You can play music downstairs by saying:  
`Hey Google play The Beatles`
### Frontdoor
You must pull the handle up before it will lock.
### Kitchen
Most of Rafa's things are kept above the microwave. (milk formula, bottles, fruit pouches)
